I am a product-focused data scientist with experience leading the development of solutions that understand user needs, inform decisions, enhance products, and discover and prioritize opportunities across the healthcare, retail, customer experience, and technology sectors. I have experience scoping and managing projects, aligning business goals with best practices, communicating complex concepts to all audiences, and delivering end-user-focused documentation.

Outside of work, I'm an active member of my local and larger tech communities. As the Director of Operations of Women in Analytics, a global community that promotes visibility to women making an impact in the analytics space, my primary focuses lie in marketing, strategy, and community growth. Since joining the team, we have launched multiple initiatives including the Ambassador Program, Women to Watch, Membership, WIA After Hours Podcast, and merchandise while expanding numerous others.
